### *REASON FOR TAKING UP THIS PROJECT* :
<br />
In today's time, everything is on internet. We have a Website for every task. All these websites demand for a user account and therefore we have to remember the passwords for
all these websites or apps. Sometimes due to so many password in our mind , we cannot recollect which site has which password.
<br />
Hence, I came up with a Solution so that you can keep all your passwords safely and securely at one place.

<br /><br />
### *ABOUT THE PROJECT*  : 
<br />
This project serves as a password manager where user can login to their account ( if new user then sign Up). User can store password of different sites for example their facebook , instagaram,twiter
and other accounts password. They can view these passwords anytime on their portal which make them free from remembring tons of passwords.
Users can even Update the already stored passoword in case it is changed by them.

<br /><br />

1. FRONTEND   -: HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT and TWIG
2. BACKEND    -: EXPRESS, NODEJS and JAVASCRIPT.
3. DATABASE   -: MONGODB



<br /><br />
### *SPECIAL FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT* :
1. Fully Responsive Website
2. Fully working Sign In and Sign Up page.
3. Add a new password for a wesite or an app or anything else.
4. Update the already stored password if required.
5. View all the password you have stored.
6. Have a user panel.
7. User can change the password for his/her Passsword management System Account.

<br /><br />
